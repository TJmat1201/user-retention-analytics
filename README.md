# User Retention & Engagement Analytics — Portfolio Project

**Role alignment:** Product / Business Analyst (data-focused) — demonstrates retention analysis, feature impact evaluation, cohort analysis, churn modeling, and stakeholder-ready deliverables.

**Project summary:**  
This project simulates and analyzes user engagement data for a mobile app to answer product questions such as:
- How does retention change by signup cohort?
- Which features drive engagement and purchases?
- Can we predict churn from early user behavior?
- Did a simulated feature launch improve engagement or revenue?

**What you’ll find in this repo**
- `data/` — simulated datasets (`app_users.csv`, `app_sessions.csv`)
- `notebooks/` — modular notebooks covering every analysis step
- `src/utils.py` — helper functions used across notebooks
- `visuals/` — exported charts for portfolio inclusion
- `portfolio/executive_summary.md` — succinct business-facing summary

**Key skills demonstrated**
- SQL-like aggregation in Python (Pandas)
- Cohort & retention analysis
- Funnel & engagement analytics
- A/B test and feature impact evaluation
- Churn prediction (Logistic Regression & Random Forest)
- Data storytelling (executive summary & visuals)
- Dashboarding-ready outputs
